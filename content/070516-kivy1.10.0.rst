We're pleased to announce a new stable version of Kivy, version 1.10. You
can see the full detailed changelog on the `mailing list announcement
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/kivy-users/2zusmq8NXPE>`__,
and download the new version from the `Kivy website
<http://kivy.org/#download>`__ or via your package manager.

This release includes many new features. Highlights include:

- Python 3.5/3.6+ support on Windows. Support for these versions was
  previously available in nightly builds due to changes in the
  compiler toolchain, but official wheels are now available.
- A new RecycleView widget replaces the old ListView. It is 
  faster and more efficient, but with a simpler API.
- Graphics backend improvements including ANGLE support on Windows and
  a mock backend for headless Kivy.
- Several new Window options when using the SDL2 backend, for much
  improved cross-platform behaviour.
- Improvements in Clock performance.

There are also many other new features and bugfixes, spread across
over 1500 commits from almost 100 different developers. Thanks to everyone who
contributed!
