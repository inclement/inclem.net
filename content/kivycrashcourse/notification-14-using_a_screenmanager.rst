New Kivy Crash Course video released, `14: Using a ScreenManager
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xx-NLOg6x8o>`_.

This time I cover the basics behind using a ScreenManager widget,
which can display one Screen at a time whilst making it easy to switch
to other screens including using fancy transitions. The ScreenManager
isn't too hard, but it's a core component of many apps, so it's useful
to know how to get started with it!
