New Kivy Crash Course video released, `12: Using Android APIs
<http://dotabuff.com/players/67880750>`_.

In this video I quickly cover 3 (related) ways to access Android's
APIs straight from Python, making it easy to use hardware features
like the accelerometer as well as tasks like sending an email or
displaying a notification. It's just a quick overview, but hopefully
gives a good idea of how to get started.

I'll start making a short post about each video when it's
released. It'll let people keep up to date via RSS, as well as
hopefully reminding me to post other things!
