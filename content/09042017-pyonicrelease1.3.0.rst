I've just released Pyonic interpreter 1.3. As usual you can download it
from Google Play, for `Python 2.7
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.inclem.pyonicinterpreter>`__
or `Python 3.6
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.inclem.pyonicinterpreter3>`__.
The APKs can also be downloaded directly `from Github
<https://github.com/inclement/Pyonic-interpreter/releases/tag/v1.3.0>`__
(where the `source code
<https://github.com/inclement/Pyonic-interpreter>`__ is also
available).

The main addition in this release is a file browser interface, which
gives Pyonic the ability to load and execute files in the
interpreter. This is mildly useful on its own, and I've had comments
that people would like to be able to do it, but it's also groundwork
for full support for file editing support. I hope to add these
features in a future version.
