Pyonic interpreter 0.7 has just been released. There are now two
versions, one `for Python 2.7
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.inclem.pyonicinterpreter`__
and one `for Python 3.5
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.inclem.pyonicinterpreter3>`__. This
release also includes a new settings screen and rearranged gui.

The app uses exactly the same code under both Python versions. This
code is open source and available online `on Github
<https://github.com/inclement/Pyonic-interpreter>`__.

This release includes most of the short term improvements I had
planned, since supporting Python 3 didn't raise any major issues. I
expect that development will now focus on adding a few more usability
tweaks, then working with the Python packaging to add features like
pip installs for new modules, code editing (rather than just the
interpreter interface), and support for GUI creation via Kivy.
