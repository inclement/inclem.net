About
#####

This site contains my simple blog, containing mainly tutorials for the
`Kivy <http://kivy.org>`_ graphical framework. I created it after
making a series of `video tutorials
<http://www.youtube.com/kivycrashcourse>`_ that turned out to be quite
popular. Some of the posts here are standalone write-ups of each
video.

These pages are constructed using `Pelican
<http://blog.getpelican.com/>`_, a static website generator for
Python. The source is all publicly available `on github
<https://github.com/inclement/inclem.net>`_.

The website theme is a modified version of `TuxLite ZF
<https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/tuxlite_zf>`_. You
can find my modifications `here
<https://github.com/inclement/pelican-inclemnet-theme>`_.
