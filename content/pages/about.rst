About
#####

This is my blog, focusing on my exploits as a core developer of the
cross-platform `Kivy graphical framework <http://kivy.org>`_ for
Python, especially the development of its `python-for-android
<https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android>`__ build tools. I
originally created it to host my series of `video tutorials
<http://www.youtube.com/kivycrashcourse>`_ that turned out to be quite
popular. Some of the posts here are standalone write-ups of each
video.

These pages are constructed using `Pelican
<http://blog.getpelican.com/>`_, a static website generator for
Python. The source is all publicly available `on github
<https://github.com/inclement/inclem.net>`_.

The website theme is a modified version of `TuxLite ZF
<https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/tuxlite_zf>`_. You
can find my modifications `here
<https://github.com/inclement/pelican-inclemnet-theme>`_.
