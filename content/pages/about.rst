About
#####

I am a scientific researcher currently based in South West England,
with a particular interest in scientific computation and software
development.

This is my blog about my personal projects and interests, especially
as a core developer of the cross-platform `Kivy graphical framework
<http://kivy.org>`_ for Python. I'm particularly involved in
maintaining the `python-for-android
<https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android>`__ APK packaging tool,
which supports multiple types of Python apps (not just Kivy!). I
originally made this site to host my series of `video tutorials
<http://www.youtube.com/kivycrashcourse>`_ that turned out to be quite
popular.

These pages are constructed using `Pelican
<http://blog.getpelican.com/>`_, a static website generator for
Python. The source is all publicly available `on github
<https://github.com/inclement/inclem.net>`_.

The website theme is a modified version of `TuxLite ZF
<https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/tuxlite_zf>`_. You
can find my modifications `here
<https://github.com/inclement/pelican-inclemnet-theme>`_.
