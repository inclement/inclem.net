About
#####

This site contains my simple blog, containing mainly (or at the time
of writing, only...) tutorials for the `Kivy <http://kivy.org>`_
graphical framework. I created it after making a series of `video
tutorials <http://www.youtube.com/kivycrashcourse>`_ that turned out
to be surprisingly popular! My first set of topics includes
independent write-ups of each video.

These pages are constructed using `Pelican
<http://blog.getpelican.com/>`_, a static website generator for
Python. The source is all publicly available `on github
<https://github.com/inclement/inclem.net>`_.
