Kivy Crash Course
#################

This site was originally kicked off by the apparently warm reception
to my Kivy Crash Course series of youtube videos, which you can find
on my `youtube channel
<https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=SPdNh1e1kmiPP4YApJm8ENK2yMlwF1_edq>`_. This
series starts from scratch and moves quickly through different Kivy
features in about 10 minutes per video. My first set of posts here
are/will be standalone write-ups of these.

I maintain a `separate github repository
<https://github.com/inclement/kivycrashcourse>`_ with the original kivy crash
course files and any accompanying notes. Everything relevant is linked to from
the individual articles or videos.

I'm not short of ideas for future crash course entries, but if you
have any suggestions please feel free to `contact me <{filename}/pages/about.rst>`_.
