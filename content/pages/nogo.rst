:slug: noGo

I created the free, open source goban app noGo. It's designed for
Android, though you can also run it on a desktop. You can download it
from `Google Play
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.inclem.nogo>`_, or
on Amazon's `Android store
<http://www.amazon.com/Alexander-Taylor-noGo/dp/B00EZZMLCG/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1389561523&sr=8-2&keywords=nogo+android>`_,
or access the source code directly `on Github
<https://github.com/inclement/noGo>`_.

Features include:

- Ability to create, record and view go games.
- Over 1000 built in professional games.
- Tablet mode.
- Open and edit multiple games simultaneously.
- Several different board/stone themes.
- Guess mode (with hints!), what percentage of professional moves can you guess when replaying a game?
- Navigate mode, tap anywhere on the board to move back and forth.
- Manage the game tree by replacing, inserting, editing and rearranging move nodes.
- Edit mode to add/remove markers (triangle, square, circle etc.) and stones.
- Autoplay at different possible speeds.
- Area score mode.
- All games saved as standard sgf.

My main objective when making the app was to improve on the board
interface of all the existing applications. I tried to do this by
creating a modal interface so that screen space could be dedicated to
different things depending on the current task. For instance, when
navigating through a game, it is more useful to be able to tap on the
board to advance the game without worrying about placing stones. I
think this works nicely, you can download and decide for yourself!

It's been a little while now since noGo received a significant
update. I intend to come back to it, but it was my first Android
application and I'm increasingly aware of how much better its backend
could be designed! Any comments/criticism/suggestions are still
appreciated, and I'll try to incorporate them! You can email me at
