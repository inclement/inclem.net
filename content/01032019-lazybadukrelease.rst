A few days ago I released `Lazy Baduk
<https://github.com/inclement/LazyBaduk>`__, a Leela Zero analysis
tool for Android (although it also runs on the desktop).

Lazy Baduk focuses on making it as easy as possible to start entering and
analysing moves with Leela Zero, with core support for pondering,
variation display, AI play (including autoplay for black and/or
white), and a winrate graph. I've kept the interface as simple as
possible for that reason, although I may in the future add features
such as SGF save/load.

The version on Google Play uses the last 15x192 network, from July
last year, as a tradeoff between strength and analysis speed. Larger
networks are both noticeably slower to load on a phone, and slower to
generate playouts. I'm not sure what is the best choice to balance
strength and speed, but the current version seems to perform fairly
well.

I've also made available some other network versions for direct
download. The apps have different names and can be installed
simultaneously if you want:

- `Latest 15x192 network d351f06e <https://github.com/inclement/LazyBaduk/releases/download/0.6/lzviewer15x192-0.6-release-signed.apk>`__ the same as the version on Google Play
- `Latest 20x256 network 33986b7f <https://github.com/inclement/LazyBaduk/releases/download/0.6/lzviewer20x256-0.6-release-signed.apk>`__
- `Latest 40x256 network 85a93684 <https://github.com/inclement/LazyBaduk/releases/download/0.6/lzviewer40x256-0.6-release-signed.apk>`__ this one especially is much larger and slower to load than the 15x192 version
- `Elfv2 <https://github.com/inclement/LazyBaduk/releases/download/0.6/lzviewerElfv2-0.6-release-signed.apk>`__ the `ELF OpenGo version 2 <https://github.com/pytorch/elf>`__ weights converted for use with Leela Zero. ELF is Facebook's own implementation of a zero knowledge algorithm, and is very strong (network size 20x256).
- `9x9 <https://github.com/inclement/LazyBaduk/releases/download/0.6/lzviewer9x9-0.6-release-signed.apk>`__ uses the 9x9 weights generated by @sbf2000 `here <https://github.com/leela-zero/leela-zero/issues/1291>`__ (these may not be the strongest 9x9 weights available)
- `13x13 <https://github.com/inclement/LazyBaduk/releases/download/0.6/lazybaduk13x13-0.6-release-signed.apk>`__ uses the 13x13 weights generated `by @alreadydone <https://github.com/leela-zero/leela-zero/issues/2240#issuecomment-466476336>`__ from the 19x19 weights #205 (the linked issue describes this conversion process), apparently this network is quite strong

Lazy Baduk's source is available `on Github
<https://github.com/inclement/LazyBaduk>`__ if anyone is interested,
although it's a messy combination of the old code for my SGF editor
noGo and new code to interface with Leela Zero.. It works by including
a version of Leela Zero compiled for arm. It runs only on the CPU,
although GPU support might be possible in the future for some
devices. Leela Zero does use as much CPU power as it can, which can
drain the battery very fast - consider charging your phone while using
the app!

If this is interesting to you, you might also be interested in `lizzie
<https://github.com/featurecat/lizzie>`__ on the desktop. Or on
Android `Ah Q Go
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cn.ezandroid.aq>`__ is
a very full featured SGF client supporting many bot play options, at
the cost of less focus on diving into quick analysis.
