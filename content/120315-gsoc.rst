Kivy will be participating in the `Google Summer of Code 2015
<https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015>`__
(GSOC), under the `Python Software Foundation umbrella
<https://wiki.python.org/moin/SummerOfCode/2015>`__.  Applications are
welcomed not just for the Kivy framework itself but on all the
projects managed by the Kivy organisation including
Python-for-Android, Kivy-iOS, PyJNIus, PyOBJus, Plyer and Buildozer.
As such, GSOC projects can range in focus and difficulty from those
that should be accessible to intermediate Python users to low level
work making use of Cython, or interacting with Java and Objective C on
mobile platforms.

Our page GSOC information and suggested projects is available `here
<http://kivy.org/docs/gsoc.html>`__ and includes ideas touching all of
these areas. However, these are just guidelines and suggestions; if
you have a different idea, we're happy to discuss it.  Prospective
GSOC students should introduce themselves on the `kivy-dev mailing
list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kivy-dev>`__, and also
say hello on our `IRC channel
<http://kivy.org/docs/contact.html#irc>`__; discussions there will be
an important part of any application.

Beyond that, check out the project page linked above, and good luck
with your applications.
