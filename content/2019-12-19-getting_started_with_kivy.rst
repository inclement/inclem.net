This post collates various resources for getting started with the
`Kivy graphical framework <https://kivy.org/#home>`__ for Python.

Installation
============

Follow the `official installation documentation
<https://kivy.org/#download>`__.

Introductory resources
======================

* Official Kivy docs

  * The `official Kivy "Getting Started" pages
    <https://kivy.org/doc/stable/gettingstarted/intro.html>`__. These
    cover general introductory concepts, but are a bit eclectic.

  * Kivy's official `Pong game tutorial
    <https://kivy.org/doc/stable/tutorials/pong.html>`__

  * Kivy's `paint app tutorial
    <https://kivy.org/doc/stable/tutorials/firstwidget.html>`__.

* Text tutorials

  * My `from-scratch introduction to Kivy
    <{filename}/pages/kivycrashcourse.rst>`__ (`direct link to first
    entry <{filename}/kivy_text_tutorials/001.rst>`__).

  * My `Kivy crash course
    <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7UKmK9eQLY&list=PLdNh1e1kmiPP4YApJm8ENK2yMlwF1_edq>`__.

    <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYNWK2GpwgA&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDe_l6XiJ40yGTEqIKugAdTy>`__
    series.

  * `Kivy tutorials <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMHK6NDVlCM>`__ by Tech With Tim.

General resources
=================

* The `official Kivy documentation
  <https://kivy.org/doc/stable/api-kivy.html>`__. Linked is the API
  reference, almost everything in Kivy is documented in there somewhere.


Kivy examples
=============

Kivy comes with `many examples
<https://github.com/kivy/kivy/tree/master/examples>`__, with fairly
complete coverage of most widgets and other core features. These are
very valuable for working out how to use things.

On some platforms, the examples may be installable as a separate
package from your operating system's package manager.

See in particular:

* `Widget examples <https://github.com/kivy/kivy/tree/master/examples/widgets>`__

* `Canvas instruction examples <https://github.com/kivy/kivy/tree/master/examples/canvas>`__


Support channels
================

* The `official Kivy Discord channels <https://chat.kivy.org/>`__ are
  the single most active support channel.

* The `Kivy-users google group
  <https://groups.google.com/forum/embed/?place=forum/kivy-users>`__.

* The `issues list on Github
  <https://github.com/kivy/kivy/issues>`__. This should only be used
  if reporting an apparent bug in Kivy itself, it isn't a good place
  for generic support requests.

* Kivy users and developers may be active on `Python Discord <https://pythondiscord.com/>`__.
