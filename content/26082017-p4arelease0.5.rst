We've just officially released `python-for-android 0.5
<https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android>`__. The new version can
be downloaded via pip, or will be used by buildozer automatically in
new installations.  This release contains about 300 commits from
almost 40 different contributors. Thanks to everyone involved!

`python-for-android
<http://python-for-android.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ is a
packaging tool for turning Python scripts and apps into Android
APKs. It was originally created for use with the `Kivy graphical
framework <https://kivy.org/#home>`__, but now supports multiple kinds
of Python app including Kivy, PySDL2, a webview interface with Flask
or other webserver backend, plain Python scripts without a GUI, or other
possibilities such as Python builds for use in other applications.

This release contains many fixes and improvements to all parts of the
toolchain. Now that these have been released as stable, we intend to
move quickly to make some larger improvements including supporting
gradle builds, and better support for Python 3 in some recipes.

For full instructions and further information, see the
`python-for-android documentation
