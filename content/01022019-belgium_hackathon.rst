For the last 3 days several of the Kivy Core Developers gathered in
Brussels, Belgium for the first ever core developer hackathon. Not
only is this the first time we've gathered to work on Kivy framework
issues, but for most of us the first time we've ever met - even after
years of collaboration!

From left to right the attendees are Peter Badida (KeyWeeUsr), Gabriel
Gettier (tshirtman), Mathieu Virbel (tito), Alexander Taylor
(inclement) and Andre Miras (AndreMiras).

We used this opportunity to make amazing progress on a range of Kivy
issues. Most especially:

- 55 closed issues and 36 merged pull requests across all Kivy
  projects, specifically targeting long standing bugs and the most
  important current issues.
- A full update of `buildozer <https://github.com/kivy/buildozer>`__
  to work well with the latest SDK, NDK and other dependencies for
  Android development. New release to follow!
- Rapid progress on `ncis <https://github.com/kivy/ncis>`__, a new
  remote inspector/debugger for all types of Python application.
- Many improvements to the `python-for-android
  <https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android>`__ continuous
  integration, and some major bugfixes for stability with Python 3 and
  the latest toolchain. Preliminary 0.7.0 release already available
  via PyPI and buildozer, more to follow.
- Extensive cleanup and improvements for `PyJNIus
  <https://github.com/kivy/pyjnius>`__.
- A further ~170 closed `python-for-android
  <https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android>`__ issues and ~110
  `buildozer <https://github.com/kivy/buildozer>`__ issues, as a
  general clean up of stale and outdated reports to focus on the ones
  that really matter.

For the next two days, the same team will be attending `FOSDEM 2019
<https://fosdem.org/2019/>`__. Let us know by `discord
<https://chat.kivy.org/>`__ or `other communication
<https://kivy.org/#aboutus>`__ if you'd like to say hello!
